            <p> Though my IT skills are only in the growth stage, I’ve always had an interest, specifically around web and app development, design and user experience fields. I love the idea of being able to think of a concept then by using code and design principles to create something that helps people, animals or the environment (or all three).</p>
        <br>
            <p>My interest in IT became stronger in the past few years after I was given the opportunity to create a student website using WordPress. Even though to most IT professionals, that’s not much to write home about, it still allowed me to be creative and sparked my interest further in seeing what else the IT world had to offer. I then began to research IT careers, and this bought me to the idea of web and app design. I am also fascinated by AI and ML. I would love to build a robot dog one day...it's good to aim high.</p>
        <br>
            <p>RMIT was my first choice due to hearing great things about the level of industry ready learning and expertise of the tutors.</p>
